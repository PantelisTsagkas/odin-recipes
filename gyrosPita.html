    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pork gyro meat is made simple with the help of your Instant Pot® or other

      sliced red onion, tomato, tzatziki sauce, and feta cheese.

    <p>
      Grab an authentic Greek chicken gyro pita from a neighbourhood ‘souvlaki
      shop’ in Greece or… make it yourself at home. No need for a spit! Just
      cook marinated chicken thigh pieces in your oven. Then wrap in pita bread
      with ripe tomatoes, tangy onion, crunchy lettuce, refreshing tzatziki
      sauce and… fries!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <un>
      <li>4 pounds pork butt, cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Greek seasoning (such as Cavender's®)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    </un>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and
        select the Saute function. Place cubed pork in the pot and cook until
        starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Turn pot off.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add Greek seasoning, paprika, garlic, and chicken broth to the pot with
        the pork. Close and lock the lid. Select Manual and set timer for 35
        minutes. Allow 10 minutes for pressure to build.
      </li>
      <li>
        Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to
        manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Transfer pork to the
        skillet using a slotted spoon and cook for 5 minutes or until most of
        the liquid has evaporated and pork has a nice crisp on it.
      </li>
